# InfoSec-Work
Welcome! This repository showcases projects related to cybersecurity and computer science education.

I'm a computer science teacher with 20 years of experience in K-12 education, with a passion for both pedagogy and technology. After discovering my interest in cybersecurity, I pursued a Master's degree in the field and obtained the CISSP certification.  I'm also a certified educator through CMU Academy and a trainer for Code.org.

This repository reflects my dual focus. You'll find:

Cybersecurity Projects: These projects stem from my collaboration with the school district IT department, focusing on policy development. Here you'll find the Patch Management Policy and Schedule, and the Data Retention Policy for the district.
Educational Resources (Future): I plan to add resources related to computer science education in the future.
I'm constantly learning and growing. Feel free to explore the repository and reach out if you have any questions!
